# SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensions - Sample Scenarios Support

The repository hosts _issues_ for SAP S/4HANA Extensibility Scenarios from [SAP Extensibility Explorer](https://www.sap.com/extends4). For more information on particular samples including detailed descriptions, source codes and setup guides, please refer to the [samples list page](http://tiny.cc/s4-ext-samples) or follow the links in the table below.



Limitations / Disclaimer
------------------------
Note: Sample extension scenarios are designed to help you get an overall understanding of various extensibility concepts/patterns. SAP  recommends not to use these samples for any productive usage. They show basic interaction with an S/4HANA Cloud system. Topics like authentication, error handling, transactional correctness, security, caching, tests were omitted on purpose for the sake of simplicity. For detailed information on development on the SAP Cloud Platform, please consult https://www.sap.com/developer.html
